Do you like throwing bread at ducks? Well stop it.

TL;DR: Multiple studies (lost the sources lol oops) show that bread is NOT HEALTHY for ducks. So don't throw bread at ducks. If you are hanging out at your local pond or whatever environment happens to have beavers or ducks or fish or frogs or herons or geese or turtles, you can now upload a picture of an animal listed above to see what it eats. Apparently you're not supposed to feed wild animals at all so this is still technically good for information. Even if it's only 7 pieces of information. If I wasn't so incompetent as to try to make my own miserable dataset rather than searching a little better online then I probably could have done a lot more categories. Too bad

<summary>The Algorithm</summary>

This project uses a resnet-18 network that is retrained to focus on different types of animals found near ponds: beavers, ducks, fish, frogs, herons, geese, and turtles. The model takes an image and classifies it as one of these seven animals, and then the algorithm creates a copy of the image with labels that show the animal's name and what the animal eats.

1. Import the necessary modules.

2. Add input and output arguments in command line.

3. Define input and output from arguments.

4. Load the recognition network. This project uses resnet-18.

5. (Optional) Delete previous outputs.

6. Create fonts for overlay.

7. Capture the next image/frame.

8. Classify the image/frame using the recognition network.

9. Print the top class prediction.

10. Choose information on label depending on the class prediction.

11. Add the name and diet labels to the output image.

## Running this project

1. Make sure the following are installed on your jetson: [resnet-18](), [jetson-inference](https://www.github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/)
2. go to home/nvidia/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data/ in terminal
3. download data into training/classification/data/
4. go to home/nvidia/jetson-inference in terminal
5. ./docker/run.sh into jetson-inference/python/training/classification
6. train.py parameter parameter parameter
7. export onnx i forgot what the script was called and my ssh is not working so i can not see
8. type exit to exit the docker i guess
9. go to home/nvidia/pond/ in terminal for lack of a better or more logical name
10. python3 pond_imagenet.py {image file path} {file path for output}
11. ignore how the model has like 30% accuracy
12. go to home/nvidia/pond/output/ in vscode (look at the file list) and open new files to SEE
