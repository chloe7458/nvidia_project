# professional project name

This project uses a resnet-18 network that is retrained to focus on recognizing different types of animals found near ponds: beavers, ducks, fish, frogs, herons, geese, and turtles. The model takes an image and classifies it as one of these seven animals, and then the algorithm creates a copy of the image with labels that show the animal's name and what the animal eats.

## The Algorithm

      9. Enter the password.
  
          ![](https://i.ibb.co/pv2t2xg/Capture2bxi.png)
          
      10. Select "Open Folder..." and enter "/home/".

          ![](https://i.ibb.co/4jXmZ5b/Capture2bxii.png)
   
   </details>

3. Download the [data](https://github.com/chloe7458/nvidia_project/tree/master/data) folder to your computer and move the contents into **/home/nvidia/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data/**.

4. Download the [models](https://github.com/chloe7458/nvidia_project/tree/master/models) folder to your computer and move the contents into **/home/nvidia/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/models/pond/**.

   Overall, the classification folder should look like this:

   ![](https://i.ibb.co/stJgXr1/Capturenewnewnew-one.png)

5. Open the terminal and navigate to **/home/nvidia/jetson-inference/**.

   ```
   $ cd nvidia/jetson-inference/
   ```
   
6. Open the docker container and enter the password.

   ```
   $ ./docker/run.sh
   ```

7. Navigate to **/jetson-inference/python/training/classification/** in the docker container.

   ```
   # cd python/training/classification/
   ```

8. Re-train the network using the data for this project.

   ```
   # python3 train.py --model-dir=models/pond/ data/pond/
   ```

9. Press ```Ctrl+C``` at any time to pause training.

    <details>
       <summary>Resuming training</summary>
      
       1. To resume training, run ```train.py``` with these parameters:
         
          ```
          # python3 train.py --resume models/pond/model_best.pth.tar --model-dir=models/pond data/pond
          ```
       
       2. If you get a silly error on line 196 about the best_accuracy variable, open ```train.py``` using this command.
          
          ```
          # nano train.py
          ``` 

          Look for these lines and comment them out, then save the file.
         
          Try running the file again and it should work.

    </details>

10. Export the re-trained model using this command.

    ```
    # python3 onnx_export.py --model-dir=models/pond
    ```

    You should see the ONNX file in the explorer.
  
11. When you are satisfied with the training, pause again and exit the docker container.

    ```
    # exit
    ```
    
12. You should be back at **/home/nvidia/jetson-inference/**. Navigate to **/home/nvidia/pond/**.

    ```
    $ cd ..
    $ cd pond/
    ```
    
13. To use the model, run ```pond_imagenet.py```.
    This command will make the model process all of the beaver images in the dataset for this project and saves the outputs to **/home/nvidia/pond/output/**.

    ```
    $ python3 pond_imagenet.py ../jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data/pond/test/beaver/"*.jpg" output/"output_%i.jpg"
    ```

    To process your own images, upload them to VSCode and change the file paths in the command.

14. Open the output files in VSCode to see the results.
